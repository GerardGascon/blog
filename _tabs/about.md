I am Gerard, a young, self-taught game developer focused mainly on programming.

I have worked on over a dozen game jam games and developed most of my programming skills, such as rapid prototyping, and also some game design experience, like finding ways to satisfy the player when playing my games.

Currently, I am studying software engineering at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya and spending my free time in my search for new skills while also developing some games, such as Just in Crime.
